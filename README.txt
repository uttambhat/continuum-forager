This program simulates foraging on random landscapes



Challenges
----------
1. Life-time is tied to a forager. No global time-keeping mechanism yet. This will be required when simulating multiple foragers
2. Some of the functions don't yet depend on _size and assume _size=1.L
3. Make dimension a parameter
