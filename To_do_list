Challenges
----------
1. Life-time is tied to a forager. No global time-keeping mechanism yet. This will be required when simulating multiple foragers
2. Some of the functions don't yet depend on _size and assume _size=1.L
3. Make dimension a parameter


Checkout fractal landscapes paper and compare to two species competition

Coherence and conservation

mixing zetas

mu zeta and number of species

slope of a Damuth's law as a function of zeta

Make a function to sum maps.

Make a consume function to consume from selected (multiple) maps

Add CUDA kernels to speed up code

Adapt code for 3D visualization


-------------------------------------------------
Global time instead of time tied to a forager


Priority
-----------
Resource regeneration
Add periodic boundary conditions condition
two individuals with different masses

Single species single individual
---------------
1. Add regrowth at fixed positions
2. Optimal field-of-vision, optimal intelligence
3. Life-history parameter optimization
4. Food-time distribution as a function of zeta
5. Gravity model sensing distance vs zeta optimality


Single species population
-------------------
1. Island size rule
2. Optimal field-of-vision,
3. Life-history parameter optimization


Multispecies single individual per species
----------------------------------
1. Efficiency of clearing resources with multiple 
2. Island size, mass, mass+dmass competition


Multispecies population
--------------------
1. Population



Comparisons
----------
Compare to NSM timescales of starvation and reproduction
